The Whitehall II analyses for the McGregor meta-analysis paper were conducted on 3rd of June 2019 with the latest GitHub version of GGIR at the time [link](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/tree/e44e5308749337b6bf76d20753d418c1a8c62910), which corresponds to GGIR CRAN version 1.9-2 that was released a month later.

At the time we ran the analysis, GGIR was not enhanced yet with the option to store a provenance log of all internal parameters. This only became available in version 1.10-1 two months later. This is why I am including original [R script](call_GGIRshell_pbs.R) with all the explicitly provided function argument attached.
